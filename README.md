The purpose of this project is to analyze the activity of 6 participants to determine how well they perform
activities. The data are from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, and dumbell use of the 6 participants.
They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.
Information on other uses of the data for this project can be found at http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har
(see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).
This project involves classification. The goal is to classify the the manner in which the participant did the
exercise.
If the exercise was performed exactly to specifications (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B),
lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the
hips to the front (Class E). See (VBGUF 2015)
Key points in the process are 1) Classify the manner in which the exercise was done. 2) The classification
model should be built using features and cross-validataion. 3) As a performance measure calculate the out of
sample error. 4) Finally, use the test data and the model to correctly classify 20 test cases.
